# General Interview Question


1.Tell me about yourself.

Explain work experience, what I am currently doing, why you are a qualified candidate.

不要涉及私人生活 讲一个专业职场的故事 (engaging, compelling, clear and compare)

snapshot of work history (工作时间线) -> company name, title, how many years in that role and major responsibility

I started off my career 4 years ago as a junior software developer at global iqx company. Where I worked as a full stack Java developer to maintain and develop

new features for the insurance quoting and trading platform. I preform a full life cycle development duty which includes design, implement and testing the 

new features on a daily basic. The second position I held is with Ross Video, I also worked as a software developer, I am responsible to maintain a desktop based Java 

SE application, design a new communication protocol and debug the Ross switcher device. My current position is with Nuance, I worked with Nuance Digital Engagement 

team which is a cloud native on-line customer service platform. My daily job is to work with the product manager to analyze user requirement, write the design document 

and implement API for the front end team. The main technology stack is container and java.  

+ 工作的成就 (save time, save money, improve process)

In my current job, my major accoplishment that I am most proud of is that I drive the authentication and authorization upgrade from session to OAuth2.0. The original 

auth is based on session which is highly depend on the web and not applicable to mobile, also it cause overhead when we add new servers to the cluster. I find this 

issue and did some research find that OAuth2 and JWT token can solve the current issue. So I proposed to my team leader and did a demo to the whole team. After 

serveral discussions, I convinced my team leader to upgrade the auth framework. And then I helped to write the design document and create the JIRA tickets. Now the new 

auth framework is on production and the auth time required decreased 30%, also since the OAuth2 uses JWT token, the overhead of the server is reduced.

What I learned is that communication and teamwork is really important, also it is critical to deep dive the source of an issue, then we can have innovation and new 

ideas to sovle them.
